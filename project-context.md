# IIT JU Alumni Frontend ‚Äì Context Summary

## üèóÔ∏è Overall Purpose & Backend Connection

This project is a frontend web application for the IIT JU Alumni Network, designed to connect alumni of Jahangirnagar University. It provides features such as alumni search, real-time chat, event management, group creation, and profile management. The frontend communicates with a microservices-based backend system (see below), primarily via a REST API gateway (`http://localhost:8000/ijaa/api/v1/user` by default, configurable via `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`).

**Backend System:**

- Java 17, Spring Boot 3.4.3, Spring Cloud 2024.0.0
- Microservices: API Gateway, User Service, Discovery Service, Config Service
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT-based authentication (HMAC-SHA256, 1h expiry)
- User context propagated via `X-USER_ID` header (Base64-encoded JSON)

## üîê Authentication Flow (Frontend & Backend Integration)

- **Unified Context-based**: `UnifiedAuthContext` provides unified authentication for both users and admins, replacing separate `AuthContext` and `AdminAuthContext`.
- **Single Source of Truth**: One context manages both user and admin states, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistent navbar visibility.
- **JWT Storage**: On successful login, JWT and user/admin info are stored in `localStorage` under `alumni_user` or `admin_user` respectively.
- **Login**: Credentials are sent to `/signin` (users) or `/login` (admins) endpoints; on success, token and userId/adminId are saved.
- **Logout**: Clears all authentication state from context and localStorage.
- **Session Conflict Resolution**: When one user type logs in, the other type's session is automatically cleared to prevent conflicts.
- **Auth Headers**: When making API requests (e.g., with Axios), the JWT is included in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- **X-USER_ID Header**: For authenticated requests, the frontend should propagate the user context via the `X-USER_ID` header, containing a Base64-encoded JSON string (e.g., `{ "username": "john.doe" }`). This is required by the backend gateway for user context propagation.
- **Session Persistence**: On app load, checks localStorage for existing user or admin session.
- **Cross-tab Synchronization**: Storage change events ensure authentication state is synchronized across browser tabs.
- **No Axios Interceptors**: Headers are set per-request, not globally via interceptors.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are never stored in the frontend; only sent to backend for authentication.
- **Enhanced Email Validation**: SignUp component includes comprehensive email validation using regex pattern `/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/` to validate email format, domain, and TLD.

---

## üîå API Interaction Setup

- **Base URL**: Set via `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` environment variable.
- **Axios**: Imported and used directly in page components for API calls.
- **Headers**: JWT token injected manually in each request requiring authentication. For backend compatibility, the `X-USER_ID` header should be included for all authenticated requests.
- **No global Axios instance or interceptors**: Each request sets headers as needed.
- **API Gateway**: All requests are routed through the API gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway, port 8000).

## üìÑ Unique or Noteworthy Aspects

- **Microservices Awareness**: The frontend is designed to interact with a microservices backend via a single API gateway, and is aware of service boundaries (e.g., AuthService, ProfileService, AlumniSearchService).
- **Unified Authentication System**: Single `UnifiedAuthContext` manages both user and admin authentication, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistent UI state across browser tabs.
- **Session Conflict Resolution**: Automatic clearing of conflicting sessions when switching between user types, fixing navbar visibility issues.
- **Cross-tab Synchronization**: Storage change events ensure authentication state is synchronized across browser tabs.
- **Theme Persistence**: Dark/light mode is persisted in localStorage and respects system preference
- **Manual JWT Handling**: No global Axios instance; JWT is manually injected per request
- **X-USER_ID Header**: For all authenticated API calls, the frontend should include the `X-USER_ID` header with a Base64-encoded JSON string of the user context (e.g., `{ "username": "john.doe" }`).
- **Clean Logo Design**: Navbar logo displays as image only without background color for a cleaner, more professional appearance
- **No .env file in repo**: But environment variable usage is present in code
- **No global error boundary or toast notifications**: Errors are handled inline in forms/pages
- **No Redux or Zustand**: State management is via React Context only

## Recent Updates and Fixes

### Profile Photo Integration in Navbar and Search Page (Latest)
- **Issue**: Navbar profile icon and search page user cards were not displaying actual user profile photos from the API
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive profile photo integration system:
  - **Created `useCurrentUserPhoto` hook**: Fetches current user's profile photo using photoApi
  - **Created `useUserPhoto` hook**: Fetches profile photos for specific users by userId
  - **Created `UserCard` component**: Reusable component that displays user information with profile photos
  - **Updated Navbar component**: Now displays current user's actual profile photo instead of fallback image
  - **Updated Search page**: Now uses UserCard component to display user profile photos in search results
- **Result**: 
  - Navbar profile icon now shows the current user's actual profile photo
  - Search page user cards now display each user's profile photo from the API
  - Fallback images are used when profile photos are not available

### Photo API URL Conversion Fix (Previous)
- **Issue**: Backend was returning relative URLs (e.g., `/ijaa/api/v1/users/{userId}/profile-photo/file/{fileId}.jpg`) but frontend needed absolute URLs
- **Solution**: Implemented `convertToAbsoluteUrl` helper function in `photoApi.js` that:
  - Detects if URL is already absolute (starts with http/https)
  - Extracts domain and port from base URL (removes path components)
  - Converts relative URLs to absolute URLs by prepending domain
  - Handles URLs with and without leading slashes
- **Result**: Profile and cover photos now display correctly with full URLs like `http://localhost:8000/ijaa/api/v1/users/{userId}/profile-photo/file/{fileId}.jpg`
- **Testing**: Updated all photo-related tests to verify URL conversion functionality
- **Files Modified**:
