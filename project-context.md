# IIT JU Alumni Frontend ‚Äì Context Summary

## üèóÔ∏è Overall Purpose & Backend Connection

This project is a frontend web application for the IIT JU Alumni Network, designed to connect alumni of Jahangirnagar University. It provides features such as alumni search, real-time chat, event management, group creation, and profile management. The frontend communicates with a microservices-based backend system (see below), primarily via a REST API gateway (`http://localhost:8000/ijaa/api/v1/user` by default, configurable via `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`).

**Backend System:**
- Java 17, Spring Boot 3.4.3, Spring Cloud 2024.0.0
- Microservices: API Gateway, User Service, Discovery Service, Config Service
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT-based authentication (HMAC-SHA256, 1h expiry)
- User context propagated via `X-USER_ID` header (Base64-encoded JSON)

## üîê Authentication Flow (Frontend & Backend Integration)

- **Unified Context-based**: `UnifiedAuthContext` provides unified authentication for both users and admins, replacing separate `AuthContext` and `AdminAuthContext`.
- **Single Source of Truth**: One context manages both user and admin states, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistent navbar visibility.
- **JWT Storage**: On successful login, JWT and user/admin info are stored in `localStorage` under `alumni_user` or `admin_user` respectively.
- **Login**: Credentials are sent to `/signin` (users) or `/login` (admins) endpoints; on success, token and userId/adminId are saved.
- **Logout**: Clears all authentication state from context and localStorage.
- **Session Conflict Resolution**: When one user type logs in, the other type's session is automatically cleared to prevent conflicts.
- **Auth Headers**: When making API requests (e.g., with Axios), the JWT is included in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- **X-USER_ID Header**: For authenticated requests, the frontend should propagate the user context via the `X-USER_ID` header, containing a Base64-encoded JSON string (e.g., `{ "username": "john.doe" }`). This is required by the backend gateway for user context propagation.
- **Session Persistence**: On app load, checks localStorage for existing user or admin session.
- **Cross-tab Synchronization**: Storage change events ensure authentication state is synchronized across browser tabs.
- **No Axios Interceptors**: Headers are set per-request, not globally via interceptors.
- **Password Security**: Passwords are never stored in the frontend; only sent to backend for authentication.
- **Enhanced Email Validation**: SignUp component includes comprehensive email validation using regex pattern `/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/` to validate email format, domain, and TLD.

---

## üîå API Interaction Setup

- **Base URL**: Set via `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` environment variable.
- **Axios**: Imported and used directly in page components for API calls.
- **Headers**: JWT token injected manually in each request requiring authentication. For backend compatibility, the `X-USER_ID` header should be included for all authenticated requests.
- **No global Axios instance or interceptors**: Each request sets headers as needed.
- **API Gateway**: All requests are routed through the API gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway, port 8000).

## üìÑ Unique or Noteworthy Aspects

- **Microservices Awareness**: The frontend is designed to interact with a microservices backend via a single API gateway, and is aware of service boundaries (e.g., AuthService, ProfileService, AlumniSearchService).
- **Unified Authentication System**: Single `UnifiedAuthContext` manages both user and admin authentication, preventing conflicts and ensuring consistent UI state across browser tabs.
- **Session Conflict Resolution**: Automatic clearing of conflicting sessions when switching between user types, fixing navbar visibility issues.
- **Cross-tab Synchronization**: Storage change events ensure authentication state is synchronized across browser tabs.
- **Theme Persistence**: Dark/light mode is persisted in localStorage and respects system preference
- **Manual JWT Handling**: No global Axios instance; JWT is manually injected per request
- **X-USER_ID Header**: For all authenticated API calls, the frontend should include the `X-USER_ID` header with a Base64-encoded JSON string of the user context (e.g., `{ "username": "john.doe" }`).
- **Clean Logo Design**: Navbar logo displays as image only without background color for a cleaner, more professional appearance
- **No .env file in repo**: But environment variable usage is present in code
- **No global error boundary or toast notifications**: Errors are handled inline in forms/pages
- **No Redux or Zustand**: State management is via React Context only
- **Enhanced Button Component**: Supports `asChild` prop for polymorphic rendering, allowing buttons to render as links while maintaining styling and functionality
- **Robust Email Validation**: Comprehensive email validation in SignUp component with proper regex pattern matching
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test coverage for components with proper error handling and edge case testing
- **Build System Integrity**: Automated tests to detect missing components, orphaned imports, and structural issues
- **Robust Error Handling**: ThemeContext and other components handle test environments gracefully with proper fallbacks
- **Profile Management**: Complete profile management system with enhanced edit forms, visibility controls, and comprehensive test coverage
- **Layout Improvements**: Fixed banner width and implemented comprehensive contact field management with privacy controls
- **Planned Integrations**: Real-time chat (Firebase), video calls (WebRTC), payments (Stripe/Razorpay), social login (Google/Facebook OAuth)
